Introduction
============

As described in the README.md file, this tutorial provides details on the functions required to simulate the results presented in Section 5,6,7 and 8 of the paper. 
The python source file can be found in  [`functions.py`](https://github.com/paoloceriani/couplings_bgs/functions.py) for Gaussian CREMS and  [`functions_MH.py`](https://github.com/paoloceriani/couplings_bgs/functions_MH.py) for non Gaussian CREMS.

### `Gaussian`
**input**

**output**

**example code**
``` 
!python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/paoloceriani/couplings_bgs/blob/main/funct_simulation.py
!python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/paoloceriani/couplings_bgs/funct_simulation_MH

import funct_simulation_MH_11 as fmh
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib



```
