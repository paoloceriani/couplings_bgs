# couplings_bgs
Python code associated to the article "Linear-cost unbiased posterior estimates for crossed effects and matrix factorization models via couplings". Key contribution of the paper is, as outlined in the abstract:
> We design and analyze unbiased MCMC schemes based on couplings of blocked Gibbs samplers (BGS), whose total computational cost scales linearly with the number of param- eters and data points.

The repository contains **code** and **tutorials** for implementing such a coupling procedure. 
The source file [`functions.py`](https://github.com/paoloceriani/couplings_bgs/functions.py) contains the building blocks fore more elaborate code...
